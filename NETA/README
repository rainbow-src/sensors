Terrain generator and sink placement algorithm using k-means:
-------------------------------------------------------------
generate_terrain-kmeans.pl: Script that generates a terrain file with sensors, targets and base stations (sinks)

Base station placement scripts:
-------------------------------
read_terrain-neta.pl: Reads a terrain file generated by generate_terrain-kmeans.pl and places the base stations using NeTa algorithm
read_terrain-random.pl: Reads a terrain file generated by generate_terrain-kmeans.pl and places the base stations using a random algorithm

Sensor scheduling algorithms:
-----------------------------
generate_sets.pl: A script that generates cover sets that are connected with multiple base stations (this script is based on OCCH-critical algorithm
generate_sets-partial.pl: A script that generates cover sets that are connected with multiple base stations (this script is based on PCH algorithm

To run the scripts you need to install the following libraries:
